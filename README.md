## Get started

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Start The Client

### You will need to download the Expo Go app on the app store or play store.

```bash
 npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find multiple options to open the app

- Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal which will show you the client.
- Under the QR code will say something like "Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.158:8081".
- Please copy the numbers between exp:// and :8081 (ex. 192.186.1.158). This is your IP address! Paste it into the .env folder where it says EXPO_PUBLIC_REACT_URL=

## Start The Server

- Open a new terminal and go into the Server directory.

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm start
```
